# Equihub

**Equihub** is focused on creating innovative tools that enhance user experiences across various platforms. While not all of our tools are open-source, they are designed with transparency, efficiency, and user control in mind.

## Current Project

### [EquiMissioner](https://github.com/Equihub/EquiMissioner)

**EquiMissioner** is our premier utility script for HeroZero, designed to streamline gameplay by automating quests, managing energy, and improving overall performance. It offers features such as:

- Automated quest management
- FPS adjustment for better performance
- Custom energy management settings
- More to explore

## What's Next

We're currently developing **Equinox**, an AI-powered tool with advanced automation and customization features. Equinox will enhance your gaming experience by automatically handling almost any task in the game. With deep configuration options, you'll have full control over how Equinox operates, tailoring it to fit your personal playstyle. Stay tuned for more updates as we move closer to release.
